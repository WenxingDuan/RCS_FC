# Analyzing Google's Quantum Supremacy Experiment - Code Project

This code project is designed to provide a detailed analysis of Google's quantum random circuit sampling experiment and their claims of achieving quantum supremacy. The project uses Fourier analysis to evaluate the strength of Google's assertion and explores the discrepancy between experimental findings and theoretical expectations.

# Project Report

The report contains a detailed analysis of Google's quantum random circuit sampling experiment and their claims of achieving quantum supremacy. The author of this document employed Fourier analysis to evaluate the strength of Google's assertion and encountered an intriguing phenomenon along the way.

The document is divided into several chapters, including an introduction, background information on quantum computing, and a detailed analysis of Google's experiment. The author explores the discrepancy between experimental findings and theoretical expectations, highlighting the influence of sample size and noise in the system.

This document is a valuable resource for anyone interested in quantum computing, particularly those interested in Google's quantum supremacy claims. It provides a detailed analysis of the experiment and offers insights into the challenges associated with achieving quantum supremacy.
